In this work we present a technique for automatic music genre recognition using various machine learning techniques on Free Music Archive Dataset [4]. It is important to note that in this dataset track genres have parent/child hierarchical relationship and a certain song can have multiple labels. We therefore address this problem as multiclass classification problem instead of multilabel classification problem to reduce the complexity of the task by considering only the parent genre of every audio and ignoring the child of that parent. In addition our efforts are mostly concentrated on supervised machine learning and deep learning methods to address this problem. However we also dive into few unsupervised machine learning techniques. Along with the results of our ML models, we perform extensive and detailed analysis of feature engineering process, interpretation of confusion matrix for different classifiers and an in depth examination of convolutional neural networks on spectrograms.
